# Extraction of entities in Portuguese from the Second HAREM Golden Collection
## Abstract
Information Extraction is an essential process for automatically building a Knowledge Graph, a knowledge baserepresenting knowledge through semantic connections, and has been gaining focus in recent years. One of the tasks requiredduring this construction is Named Entity Recognition, responsible for identifying and classifying the entities in the text.  This task is the first step to generate the tuples that form the Knowledge Graph. Although there are already works that deal with this task, many of them are focused on the English  language and few on Portuguese. Therefore, the goal of this work was the development of machine learning models capable of extracting entities from texts in Portuguese. The model was used to extract entities through Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and was trained and evaluated using a simplified version of the Second HAREM Golden Collection dataset, a golden standard for NLP in Portuguese. After evaluating the model, it was observed that the results obtained in the NamedEntity Recognition task were promising for the primary classes present in the dataset.
